## User Tips
- This web app is designed for UW-Madison students, so it only supports UW-Madison course schedule format.
- The format is sensitive, so please make sure you copy the schedule list correctly. (Make sure include the weekdays in the schedule list)
- Please double check the start and end time of your class is correct (end time should be later than start time!!). If not, the event will have no week repeat.
