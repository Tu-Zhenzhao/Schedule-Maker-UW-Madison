## User Tips
- This web app is designed for UW-Madison students, so it only supports UW-Madison course schedule format.
- The format is sensitive, so please make sure you copy the schedule list correctly. (Make sure to copy the entire schedule list under the calendar then paste into the "Schedule List" box.)
- Please double check the start and end time of your class is correct (end time should be later than start time!!). If not, the event will have no week repeat.
